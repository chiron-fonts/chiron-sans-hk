## About

**Chiron Sans HK (昭源黑體)** is a sans-serif CJK typeface designed for Traditional Chinese users, especially for those in Hong Kong. It is derived from [Source Han Sans](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-han-sans), a Pan-CJK typeface jointly developed by Adobe and Google.

## Motivation

Source Han Sans version 2.0 released in late 2018 was a major update to version 1.0. This version added a second Traditional Chinese flavor adhering to Hong Kong’s orthography standard. The glyphs in this new HK variant were designed according to the then latest published *[Reference Glyphs for Chinese Computer Systems in Hong Kong (香港電腦漢字參考字形)](https://www.ogcio.gov.hk/en/our_work/business/tech_promotion/ccli/cliac/reference_glyphs.html)* document.

Glyphs depicted in this document are of no doubt more suitable for Hong Kong when compared to Taiwan’s orthography standard, reflected in the *Standard Typefaces for Chinese Characters* or *國字標準字體* documents which the original Traditional Chinese variant of Source Han Sans was based on. However, the document's general principle of adopting the stroke types of written form (Kai Style 楷書) for the printed form (usually represented by Song Style 宋體) still resulted in some odd-looking character shapes being introduced to printed form typefaces.

Based on the Traditional Chinese (Hong Kong) variant of Source Han Sans, **Chiron Sans HK** took references from successful commercial Traditional Chinese font products (widely used in printed materials in Hong Kong) to provide an orthographic variant that is more aesthetically pleasing, and which Hong Kong people are generally more familiar with.

A [Pro version](https://github.com/chiron-fonts/chiron-sans-hk-pro) of the font, which integrates the full glyph set of Adobe’s [Souce Sans 3](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-sans), is also available.

Please visit the [main website](https://chiron-fonts.github.io/chiron-sans-hk/) (in Chinese) for more information. The website is typesetted using the webfont build of Chiron Sans HK Pro, and there is a online preview function for you to test the font out with your desired text.
