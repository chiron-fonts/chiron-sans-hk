## About

**Chiron Sans HK (昭源黑體)** is a [Source Han Sans](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-han-sans) derived typeface for Hong Kong users.

In version 2.000, Source Han Sans added a second Traditional Chinese flavor adhering to Hong Kong’s orthography. Its glyphs are designed according to the latest *[Reference Glyphs for Chinese Computer Systems in Hong Kong (香港電腦漢字參考字形)](https://www.ogcio.gov.hk/en/our_work/business/tech_promotion/ccli/cliac/reference_glyphs.html)* released by the government in mid-2017.

The glyphs depicted in the document are of no doubt more suitable for Hong Kong (when compared against Taiwan’s orthography, reflected in the *Standard Typefaces for Chinese Characters* or *國字標準字體* documents). That said, its general principle of adopting the stroke types of written form (Kai Style 楷書) for the printed form (usually represented by Song Style 宋體) resulted in some odd-looking character shapes being introduced to typefaces generally used for printing.

Based on the Traditional Chinese (Hong Kong) variant of Source Han Sans, **Chiron Sans HK** took references from successful commercial Traditional Chinese font products (widely used in printed materials in Hong Kong) to provide an orthographic variant which Hong Kong people are generally more familiar with.

More information is available in the [Chinese README.pdf](README.pdf) document, which itself is mainly typesetted in Chiron Sans HK.
